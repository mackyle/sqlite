This directory contains components used to build an autoconf-like
package of the SQLite amalgamation: sqlite-autoconf-30XXXXXX.tar.gz

To build the autoconf amalgamation, run from the top of the canonical
source tree:

   ./configure
   make amalgamation-tarball

The amalgamation-tarball target (available in "main.mk") runs the
script tool/mkautoconfamal.sh which does the work.  Refer to that
script for details.
