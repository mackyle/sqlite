** Create a new changebatch object for detecting conflicts between

** database of the open database handle db passed as the first
** parameter. It is the responsibility of the caller to ensure that
** the database handle is not closed until after the changebatch
** object has been deleted.
**
** A changebatch object is used to detect batches of non-conflicting
** changesets. Changesets that do not conflict may be applied to the 
** target database in any order without affecting the final state of 
** the database.
**
** The changebatch object only works reliably if PRIMARY KEY and UNIQUE
** constraints on tables affected by the changesets use collation
** sequences that are equivalent to built-in collation sequence 
** BINARY for the == operation.
**
** If successful, SQLITE_OK is returned and (*pp) set to point to
** the new changebatch object. If an error occurs, an SQLite error
** code is returned and the final value of (*pp) is undefined.

** Argument p points to a buffer containing a changeset n bytes in

** if the changeset does not conflict with any changeset passed 
** to an sqlite3changebatch_add() call made on the same 
** sqlite3_changebatch* handle since the most recent call to
** sqlite3changebatch_zero(). If the changeset does conflict with 
** an earlier such changeset, SQLITE_CONSTRAINT is returned. Or, 
** if an error occurs, some other SQLite error code may be returned.
**
** One changeset is said to conflict with another if
** either:
**
**   * the two changesets contain operations (INSERT, UPDATE or 
**     DELETE) on the same row, identified by primary key, or
**
**   * the two changesets contain operations (INSERT, UPDATE or 
**     DELETE) on rows with identical values in any combination 
**     of fields constrained by a UNIQUE constraint.
**
** Even if this function returns SQLITE_CONFLICT, the current
** changeset is added to the internal data structures - so future
** calls to this function may conflict with it. If this function
** returns any result code other than SQLITE_OK or SQLITE_CONFLICT,
** the result of any future call to sqlite3changebatch_add() is
** undefined.
**
** Only changesets may be passed to this function. Passing a 
** patchset to this function results in an SQLITE_MISUSE error.
