*************************************************************************
** This file declares the interface of a simple resource management package
** which supports freeing of resources upon an abrupt, program-initiated
** termination of a function from somewhere in a call tree. The package is
** designed to be used with setjmp()/longjmp() to effect a pattern similar
** to the try/throw/catch available in some programming languages. (But see
** below regarding usage when the setmp()/longjmp() pair is unavailable.)
**
** The general scheme is that routines whose pre-return code might be
** bypassed, thereby leaking resources, do not rely on pre-return code
** to release locally held resources. Instead, they give ownership of
** such resources to this package, via xxxx_holder(...) calls, and use
** its holder_mark() and holder_free(...) functions to release locally
** acquired resources.
**
** For environments where setmp()/longjmp() are unavailable, (indicated by
** SHELL_OMIT_LONGJMP defined), the package substitutes a process exit for
** resumption of execution at a chosen code location. The resources in the
** package's held resource stack are still released. And the ability to
** free locally acquired resources as functions return is retained. This
** can simplify early function exit logic, but a body of code relying on
** process exit to ease error handling is unsuitable for use as a called
** routine within a larger application. That use is most of the reason for
** this package's existence.
