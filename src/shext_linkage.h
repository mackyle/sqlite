 * If registerScripting() has been called to register an extension's support
 * for scripting, then its methods are called, and must respond, as follows:
 *
 * When the initial line of an "execution group" is collected by the shell,
 * it calls isScriptLeader(pObj, zLineLead) to determine whether the group
 * should be considered as (eventually) being one for the script handler
 * to execute. This does not indicate whether it is good input or runnable;
 * it is only for classification (so that different parsing/collection rules
 * may be applied for different categories of shell input.) The method should
 * return true iff the group should be parsed and run by this handler. If it
 * returns false, something else will be done with the group.
 *
 * As one or more lines of an "execution group" are collected by the shell,
 * scriptIsComplete(pObj, zLineGroup, pzWhyNot) is called with the group as
 * so far accumulated. If out parameter pzWhyNot is non-zero, the method may
 * output a message indicating in what way the input is incomplete, which is
 * then the shell's responsibility to pass to sqlite3_free(). The method must
 * return true if the group is ready to be executed, otherwise false. This is
 * not the time at which to execute the accumulated group.
 *
 * After the scriptIsComplete() method returns true, or whenever the script is
 * being ignored (due to end-of-stream or interrupt), the resetCompletionScan()
 * method is called. This may be used to reset the scanning state held across
 * calls to scriptIsComplete() so that it need not scan the whole script text
 * at each call. It might do other things; it is always called after a call to
 * isScriptLeader() has returned true and scriptIsComplete() has been called.
 *
 * If a script group is complete (as above-determined), then runScript() may
 * be called to execute that script group. (Or, it may not.) It must either
 * execute it successfully and return DCR_Ok, suffer an ordinary failure and
 * return DCR_Error, or return one of the codes DCR_{Return,Exit,Abort} or'ed
 * with DCR_Error or not, to indicate extraordinary post-execute actions.
 * DCR_Return is to indicate the present execution context should be left.
 * DCR_Exit is for shell exit requests. DCR_Abort means exit with prejudice.
 *
 * An extension which has called registerScripting() should arrange to
 * free associated resources upon exit or when its destructor runs.
